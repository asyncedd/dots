## 💪 Dot files for Wez's terminal.
This is my personal dot files for [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm)!

## 🚧 Installing.
You should install some stuff before we get started.
- [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm) it self. - Duh, if we don't have it, what will you do?
- Cartograph CF. - The font. It is pay-for but, you can find Google around.

Now, we'll go install the dotfiles it self!
Just, copy paste this into your terminal.

For 🐧 *Nix systems:
```
git clone https://github.com/asyncedd/wezdots ~/.config/wezterm
```

For 🪟 Windows systems:
```
git clone https://github.com/asycnedd/wezdots %HOME%/.config/wezterm
```

Done!
